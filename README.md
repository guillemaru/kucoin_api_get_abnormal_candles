# kucoin_api_get_abnormal_candles

Use the Kucoin API to get candle information on the crypto pairs of your choice, and send a Telegram message to a bot you create whenever a candle of any pair is big enough!
Hopefully you can use that information to make trading decisions.

Have a Mac or Linux and want to make this an executable so you just have to click twice and let the program run on your computer?
Execute the following commands at the same directory level as main.js

npm i nexe -g
nexe -h
nexe main.js --build
